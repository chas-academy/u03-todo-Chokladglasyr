# My Idea
My idea is to make a To do list inspired by the christmas spirits! 

You will be able to create different, predefined lists, but also create a custom list. Even if you chosen to create a predefined list, it will still be editable. The predefined lists will also include predefined "tasks", these cannot be edited but can be deleted to create new "tasks".

The different lists with different titles/themes are:  
+ Where to go ([Event List](#event-list))
+ What to buy ([Groceries](#groceries))
+ Who to gift ([Gift List](#gift-list))
+ What to eat ([Dinner List](#dinner-list))
+ What to bake ([Dessert List](#dessert-list))
+ Where to decorate ([Decorations List](#decorations-list))  

With the different tasks for each list:  

# Event List
+ Julmarknad Gamla Stan
+ Nobel Week Lights
+ Lucia i storkyrkan
+ Barnens Lucia på förskolan
+ Julbord med jobbet

# Groceries
+ smör
+ ägg
+ ljus sirap
+ vetemjöl
+ saffran

# Gift List 
+ Mamma
+ Pappa
+ Mormor
+ Morfar
+ Svärfar

# Dinner List
+ Janssons frestelse
+ Julskinka
+ Julköttbullar
+ Kokt julkorv
+ Prinskorv

# Dessert List
+ Chokladkola
+ Lussebullar
+ Pepparkakor
+ Mintkyssar

# Decorations List
+ Pynta altan
+ Klä julgranen
+ Ta fram adventsljustakar 
+ Ljusslinga på balkongen
+ Krans på dörren

Here is my design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/HFj4q35xjuHdruXLuH8rHB/U03?node-id=0-1&t=6om5Lk0hxoBU4ifD-1)  

In another page on the shared Figma you can find the ER diagrams, however, I tried 3 different types, whereas one is on another site. So here is the [third](https://drawsql.app/teams/hej-8/diagrams/ida) version.

Conclusion: I think i preferred the [drawsql](https://drawsql.app/) since I could assign more specifics to it, the downside is I have to share a link. I can screenshot too, but through the link you can even assign specifics like 'unsigned'. I like the look of it too.
