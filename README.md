My idea is to make a To do list inspired by the christmas spirits! 

There is going to be different lists with different titles/themes
Like...
+ Where to go ([Event List](#event-list))
+ What to buy ([Groceries](#groceries))
+ Who to gift ([Gift List](#gift-list))
+ What to eat ([Dinner List](#dinner-list))
+ What to bake ([Dessert List](#dessert-list))
+ Where to decorate ([Decorations List](#decorations-list))


Here is my design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/HFj4q35xjuHdruXLuH8rHB/U03?node-id=0-1&t=6om5Lk0hxoBU4ifD-1)
In another page on the shared Figma you can find the ER diagrams, however, I tried 3 different types, whereas one is on another site. So here is the [third](https://drawsql.app/teams/hej-8/diagrams/ida) version.

Conclusion: I think i preferred the [drawsql](https://drawsql.app/) since I could assign more specifics to it, the downside is I have to share a link. I can screenshot too, but through the link you can even assign specifics like 'unsigned'. I like the look of it too.
